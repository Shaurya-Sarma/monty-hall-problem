# Proving The Monty Hall Problem Through Simulation

The Monty Hall Problem is a famous probablility puzzle and first appeared on an American television show _Let's Make A Deal_ in 1975.

> **Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?**
 
The answer is to **SWITCH** doors; this changes the odds of winning from 33.3% to 66.6%.

This project strives to prove/validate this mathematical result through a computer simulation of the problem.
